        <div> <h2>Here are some things you should know</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Studying for long hours without breaks reduces focus. Try studying for 25–30 minutes, take a 5-minute break, then continue. Short, focused sessions improve understanding and memory.</li>
            <li>Don’t wait until exams are close before asking questions. If a topic is confusing, seek clarification early—from classmates, lecturers, or study materials. Early understanding saves time and stress.</li>
            <li> Many students rely only on past questions without understanding the topic. Past questions are helpful, but real success comes from understanding the concepts behind them.</li>
            <li> Start exam preparation by organizing your notes and identifying difficult topics first. Focus more time on your weak areas while regularly revising what you already know.</li>
            <li> Consistency beats last-minute pressure. Small daily efforts are better than trying to read everything overnight before an exam.</li>
            <li>Balance is important. Make time for rest, sleep, and proper meals. A tired mind struggles to learn effectively.</li>
          </ul>
